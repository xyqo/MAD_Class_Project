        <item>ITT105 Computer Troubleshooting and Repairs. This introductory course in computer
            troubleshooting and repairs is designed to give students hands-on experience in diagnosing
            and solving some of the common hardware and software problems that can occur during the
            normal usage of a computer. </item>
        <item>ITT201 Data Communications and Networks I
            This introductory course in Data Communications and Networks is designed to give students an
            understanding of networks and how they can be used in organizations to increase efficiency.
            It will also introduce IP addressing and subnets and briefly look at security issues in networking.</item>
        <item>ITT102 Discrete Mathematics I
            This course will introduce students to the basic idea as to how computer systems are designed and provide
            a realistic picture of the internal workings and design of computer systems.</item>
        <item>ITT200 Object-Oriented Programming using C++ This course aims to broaden the studentâ€™s knowledge of concepts
            and features of an object-oriented programming language. Students will be required to use these concepts to
            design solutions for real world problems.</item>
        <item>ITT203 Data Structures and File Management I
            This is an introductory course in data structures and file management. It will introduce the concepts
            of data structures and file management so that students become more familiar with how data is organized
            and manipulated. It provides students with the theoretical framework for further advanced practical
            studies in data structures and file management.</item>
        <item>ITT301 Data Structures and File Management II
            This is an advanced practical course in data structures and file management. It will broaden the knowledge gained
            in Data Structures and File Management I. The course introduces the student to additional data structures
